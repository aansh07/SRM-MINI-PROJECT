I've recently completed an in-depth project on **Cryptocurrency Price Prediction** using Machine Learning, where I analyzed critical market patterns and forecasted future prices. Here’s a summary of my journey and insights:

### **Key Highlights:**
- 🔍 **Univariate & Bivariate Analysis**: Leveraged data analysis techniques to explore patterns in Volume, Market Cap, and Price Variation, uncovering significant market trends.
- 📊 **Data Transformation**: Converted complex datetime formats into Year, Month, Day, and more to enrich feature engineering and improve model interpretability.
- 🤖 **Model Selection - Random Forest Regressor**: Chose Random Forest due to its robustness in handling non-linear relationships, using Volume, Market Cap, and other features as inputs to predict closing prices accurately.
- 📅 **Real-World Application**: This model provides valuable insights into daily price fluctuations and trading volume dynamics, catering to the highly volatile crypto market.

### **Technical Stack**:
- 📁 **Tools & Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Jupyter Notebook for an organized, step-by-step analysis.
- 📈 **Performance Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, and RMSE to fine-tune prediction accuracy.
